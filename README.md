# leagueoflegends-team-builder
Program for the video game Teamfight Tactics that calculates probability for team synergies and drop rates for characters. 

Update 2023: This was basically an old project that was inspired by the idea of building the perfect team comp for the video game league of legends. I made this around the time I had started learning C++. Figured it'd be something neat I can apply my skills to making.
